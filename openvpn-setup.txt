# Setting Up OpenVPN Client on Ubuntu 24.04

If you're struggling to configure your OpenVPN client on Ubuntu 24.04, you're not alone. Many users have faced issues where the VPN connects to private resources but blocks access to public sites. This guide will walk you through a clear, step-by-step process to resolve this issue and set up a systemd service for managing your VPN connection seamlessly.

## Issue Overview

On Ubuntu 24.04, importing your OpenVPN configuration through Network Manager might block access to non-private resources. However, running the OpenVPN configuration directly from the terminal often works as expected. This guide will help you fix this issue and automate the VPN connection with a systemd service.

## Steps to Resolve the Issue

### 1. Modify Your OpenVPN Configuration

To ensure that your VPN works correctly with both private and public resources, update your OpenVPN configuration file (`smyth-dev-forhad-vpn-client.ovpn`) by adding the following lines:

```plaintext
script-security 2
up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
```

### 2. Create a Systemd Service for OpenVPN

Automate your VPN connection process by creating a systemd service:

#### Create and Edit the Service File

Open a terminal and create a new systemd service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smythos-vpn-dev.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenVPN connection to SmythOS Dev Servers
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/client/smythos-dev.ovpn
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Place the Configuration File

Move your OpenVPN configuration file to the appropriate directory:

```bash
sudo cp /path/to/your/smyth-dev-forhad-vpn-client.ovpn /etc/openvpn/smyth-dev-forhad-vpn-client.ovpn
```

### 3. Set Up Credentials

To securely store your VPN username and password:

#### Create the Credentials File

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/credentials
```

Add your username and password in this format:

```plaintext
username
password
```

#### Set Permissions

Protect your credentials file:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/openvpn/credentials
```

#### Update Configuration File

Ensure your OpenVPN configuration file references the credentials file:

```plaintext
auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/credentials
```

### 4. Reload Systemd and Start the Service

To apply your changes and start the VPN service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start smythos-vpn-dev.service
```

### 5. Enable the Service at Boot

Ensure your VPN starts automatically at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable smythos-vpn-dev.service
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve any issues with your OpenVPN client on Ubuntu 24.04 and efficiently manage your VPN connection with a systemd service. If you encounter any problems or have further questions, feel free to leave a comment below!
